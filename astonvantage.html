			<hr>
			<br><br>
			<img src="images/astonm 1.jpg"><br><br><br>
			<p>
				All it takes is just one look and you will immediately fall in love with the new Aston Martin Vantage GT8. This new monster car is just so easy to like inside and out.<br><br>
				The Aston Martin Vantage GT8 is a limited edition car. Only 150 cars came out of its production line which are already sold out. This method of limiting the numbers is Aston Martin’s way of increasing the residual. This will make their customers to always get their cars regardless of what they want to drive and how expensive they can be. But Aston Martin don’t really need this method of thinking because they did just a fine job with the GT8. The moment you get your eyes on it, you’ll instantly love it.<br><br>
				Racing is in Aston Martin’s blood. From outright victory at Le Mans 24 Hours in 1959, to countless race wins in GT3 and GT4 categories and a continued race and title-winning form in the production-based GTE category of the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC), Aston Martin is proud to be at the forefront of GT racing.<br><br>
				<img src="images/astonm 2.jpg"><br><br><br>
				All Aston Martin road cars possess some of that sporting DNA, but the luxury brand’s most extreme models draw directly from that knowledge and passion to deliver something altogether more overt in looks and ability. The new Vantage GT8 is just that.<br><br>
				Director of Special Projects and Motorsport, David King said: “We long held the desire to create a road car that truly reflects our racing activity at Le Mans. With the Vantage GT8, we’ve finally been able to achieve that. By focusing on weight savings and aerodynamics, we’ve taken the V8 Vantage to an entirely different level of agility and aggression. It’s a hugely exciting car honed to the keenest possible edge.”<br><br>
				<h2>Features And Highlights</h2><br><br>
				<h3>Engine</h3><br><br>
				The first thing that you will notice about the GT8 is its massive rear wing. It’s made from carbon fiber. The front splitter, roof and door sills are also made from carbon fiber as well. However, the use of carbon fiber especially on its wing and plastic rear window is optional which is a bit cheeky considering that the car has a 200k asking price. That price makes the GT8 expensive than the V8 Vantage S despite of it just having 10bhp increase from its 4.7-litre V8 engine.<br><br>
				<img src="images/astonm 3.jpg"><br><br>
				Inspired and influenced by the 2016 Aston Martin V8 Vantage GTE race car, the Vantage GT8 is a true thoroughbred. The lightest and most powerful V8 Vantage ever, the Vantage GT8’s dramatically sculpted carbon fibre bodywork has been shaped by race-bred aerodynamic function. With a super-sharp chassis tuned for track-focused agility, powered by a revised 446PS1 version of Aston Martin’s rousing 4.7-litre V8 and available with a choice of six-speed manual or seven-speed SportshiftTM II paddle-shift transmissions, the Vantage GT8 has unmistakable style, a no-nonsense stance and a driving experience that’s second to none.<br><br>
				The GT8 does feel like to be more agile than the standard V8 S. It offers a completely driving experience from the V8 S although there is only a small increase in power. The noise coming out from GT8 (especially if you fitted it with a titanium exhaust) that makes the difference between the two cars. The GT8 can produce range of sounds between idle and once you cross the 7,200rpm red line, the noise that will be coming out is enough to make any car enthusiasts tremble to their knees.<br><br>
				<h3>Chassis</h3><br><br>
				The Aston Martin Vantage GT8 is 80kg lighter than the standard V8 S. It can even be 100kg lighter if you opt for the lightweight options although you have to pay more for it. The cabin also reflects the lightweight theme, with new carbon door inserts and ultra-supportive bucket seats. As good as it looks, the GT8 doesn’t feel like a stripped-out racer inside. You can still find technologies like air conditioning and a state-of-the-art infotainment system.<br><br>
				<img src="images/astonm 4.jpg"><br><br>
				From nose to tail the motorsport inspired special edition is every inch the road racer. Wide-bodied with aerodynamics that clearly take their lead from Aston Martin Racing’s WEC contender, it features extensive use of carbon fibre with the front splitter, front and rear bumpers, fenders, side sills and rear diffuser all fashioned from the lightweight material. One of the most striking standard features is the cutaway front wheelarch, which mimics that of the GTE racer. Those wishing for the most extreme aero configuration can specify the optional Aero Pack, which adds the large rear wing and additional corner elements to the front splitter.<br><br>
				Improved performance through weight saving is central to the Vantage GT8. A standard-fit lithium ion battery sheds more vital kilos while further (optional) weight saving measures include a carbon fibre roof, polycarbonate rear screen and rear side windows and a titanium centre mounted exhaust. Together with the standard-fit lightweight carbon fibre sports seats (with manual adjustment, again to save weight) and carbon fibre door panels, this comprehensive suite of lightweight components saves up to 100kg, making the Vantage GT8 the lightest Vantage ever. Air-conditioning, a 160w audio system and Aston Martin’s latest AMi III infotainment system ensures it remains genuinely road-useable.
				<br><br><br>
				<h3>Transmission</h3><br><br>
				<img src="images/astonm 5.jpg"><br><br>
				What makes the GT8 a pleasure to drive is because of its responsiveness. It responds smoothly to all you want it to do. The GT8 is offered in two different transmissions. You can choose the six-speed manual or the seven-speed paddle shift auto transmissions. There are some concerns about its manual transmission though because the clutch is a bit heavy although the shifting is still very responsive.<br><br>
				<h3>Performance</h3><br><br>
				Starting the car will make you feel that the ground is shaking, your ears begin to swing back and forth and your heart will immediately be filled up with excitement. As soon you as get it going, it won’t take long before you can know that this is one of simplest and nicest cars to drive. It’s certainly not the fastest with an acceptable top speed of 190mph and 0-62mph in 4.4 seconds. It’s not the car that you would want to get your hands into if you want to beat those high-end Porsche models.<br><br>
				<img src="images/astonm 6.jpg"><br><br>
				The Vantage GT8 is further distinguished by a new 5-spoke alloy wheel, with ultra-lightweight seven-spoke centre-lock magnesium rims available as an option.  Both standard and optional wheels are shod with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tyres for exceptional performance on-road and track. Three optional ‘Halo‘ paint schemes are available; striking combinations of China Grey and Blue, Stratus White and Green or Stirling Green and Lime that perfectly capture the Vantage GT8’s dynamic character and performance.<br><br>
				<h2>Verdict</h2><br><br>
				<ul class="list-verdict"><strong>
					<li>Vantage GT8: taking the V8 Vantage to dynamic new extremes </li>
					<li>Race-bred Vantage GT8 is the most extreme V8 Vantage</li>
					<li>Weight savings of up to 100kg make it the lightest Vantage ever</li>
					<li>Strictly limited to 150 production cars</li></strong>
				</ul><br><br>
				<img src="images/astonm 7.jpg"><br><br>
				Announcing the introduction of the new Vantage GT8, Aston Martin CEO Dr Andy Palmer said: “Road cars are our business, but racing is the beating heart of Aston Martin. The Vantage GT8 expresses that combination perfectly: an authentic and unashamedly extreme road car that draws directly from our Le Mans racing programme to amplify the inherent dynamism that has long made the Vantage such a fine sports car. Beautifully engineered and set-up to be equally at home on a fabulous road or a demanding race track, the Vantage GT8 is a driver’s car in the truest sense of the word.”<br><br>
				Appealing to collectors as well as pure driving enthusiasts, the Vantage GT8 will be strictly limited to just 150 examples. Recommended retail price starts from £165,000 and deliveries will commence in Q4 2016.<br><br><br>
