				<h2>2012 Lamborghini Aventador J</h2><br><br>
				One year after the release of the Aventador at the Geneva Motor Show, Lamborghini are presenting a concept roadster version simply called the J. Special features include a carbon fiber upholstery known as Carbonskin, a redesigned chassis with twin roll hoops behind the seats and new bumpers with winglets.<br><br>
				<h3>Press Release</h3><br><br>
				At the 2012 Geneva Motor Show, Automobili Lamborghini is presenting the most uncompromising open super sports car of its entire history. The Lamborghini Aventador J is a force of nature on wheels – supremely powerful and supremely open. The Aventador J offers its pilot and co-pilot an utterly indescribable experience of power and dynamics. At the same time, the 515 kW / 700 hp two-seater is a first class technology showcase, combining innovative solutions and brand new materials and demonstrating Automobili Lamborghini’s enormous expertise in carbon fiber technology.<br><br>
				The Lamborghini Aventador J is a radically open automobile – exterior and interior meld into each other. The designers and engineers in Sant’Agata Bolognese have not only dispensed entirely with the roof, but also with the front windshield. This requires that drivers of the Aventador J must have the right equipment for driving at top speeds higher than 300 Km/h.<br><br>
				This kind of driving at the limit is a highly exclusive experience – the Lamborghini Aventador J is fully functional for road use. It is an absolute one-off: a one-of-a-kind piece of art.<br><br>
				“With the Lamborghini Aventador J, we have molded our brand DNA into its most definitive form to date. This automobile is as extreme and as uncompromising as only a Lamborghini can be,” says Stephan Winkelmann, President and CEO of Automobili Lamborghini. “The new Lamborghini Aventador J is the most radical open supersports car of Lamborghini’s history. Its name comes from our tradition and combines an unconventional design with technology innovation. Nowadays we are confronted with several regulations that we face in the spirit of challenge. The Aventador J is the proof that, despite the rules, Lamborghini will always make people dream, even in the future.”<br><br>
				<img src="../images/lambo 2.jpg"><br><br>
				<h3>Continuation Of A Glorious Tradition</h3><br><br>
				With the Aventador J, technically based on the Aventador, Automobili Lamborghini is carrying on its glorious brand tradition. The 1970 Jota, for instance, was the stuff of legends – a Lamborghini Miura with improved performance and virtually redesigned in every detail. It remained a one-off; although some owners subsequently had their Miuras modified to look like the Jota.<br><br>
				The letter J is derived from the sporting rules of the FIA world motorsport organization. Its “Appendix J” defines the technical specification of race cars in the various classes.<br><br>
				<h2>Features And Highlights</h2><br><br>
				<h3>Systematic Lightweight Design</h3><br><br>
				Naturally, the Aventador J benefits enormously from this unique technology package. Yet the Aventador J has a significantly different interpretation to the Aventador coupé. In this open version, the monocoque has a largely new design, including the two safety bars behind the seats. The absence of a roof, of the large windshield, of the air conditioning system and of the navigation system obviously takes it to an even lower weight. With a dry weight of 1575 kilograms, the series production Aventador LP 700-4 is already extremely light for its performance class thanks to its carbon fiber construction.<br><br>
				<h3>Carbonskin, Carbon Fiber Material</h3><br><br>
				<img src="../images/lambo 3.jpg"><br><br>
				The unique expertise of Automobili Lamborghini in the field of carbon fiber reinforced polymers is evident not only in the hi-tech monocoque, but also in the research into further innovative solutions. Unlike traditional seats, in the Aventador J seats are made of Forged COMPOSITE®, with inserts of flexible carbon fiber fabrics: a result of an innovative Lamborghini patent.<br><br>
				The specialists at Lamborghini have developed an even more amazing version of carbon fiber material for the Aventador J. In its first automotive application, this carbon fiber fabric called “Carbonskin” is made of woven carbon fibers soaked with a very special epoxy resin that stabilizes the fiber structure and keeps the material soft. Like a hi-tech fabric, the carbon fiber mats fit perfectly to every shape. In the Aventador J, the complete cockpit and parts of the seats are clad in this material and shimmer in matt carbon fiber black. It’s conceivable that in future there will be many potential applications for this freshly patented and extremely fine-looking material, even very high-end clothing.<br><br>
				<h3>The Design</h3><br><br>
				An extreme Aventador obviously needs an equally single-minded design, which goes without saying at the Centro Stile Lamborghini. Every single model from Sant’Agata Bolognese bears the unique design of the brand. Clear, precise surfaces, as well as sharp, often broken lines are among the unmistakable styling tools. They consistently emphasize the power and enormous presence of these Italian super sports cars. Not one line is ever accidental – the defining principle is always ‘form follows function’.<br><br>
				This function is very clearly defined for the Aventador J – explosive dynamics, extreme driving fun, a unique experience. Every kilometer with the Aventador J is extreme fun: something plainly evident from the very first glance.<br><br>
				<h3>Rear View Mirror Like A Periscope</h3><br><br>
				Virtually every part of the outer chassis was redesigned for the Aventador J, yet it shows the spirit of Lamborghini in its most concentrated form. The car’s dimensions are extreme: the overall length is 4890 mm, the overall width (excluding mirrors) is 2030 mm while the height is 1110 mm.<br><br>
				The highest points are marked by the rear view mirror, which is perched on an arm like a periscope, and by the two safety bars behind the seats. In place of the classic front windshield there are two small wind deflectors. The occupants of the Aventador J are confronted by the element of the wind in much the same way as a superbike rider – therefore the right clothing is prerequisite for every trip.<br><br>
				<h3>Front Scoop With Winglets</h3><br><br>
				<img src="../images/lambo 4.jpg"><br><br>
				The front of the Aventador J is somewhat narrower than that of the Aventador. The front end is dominated by a highly distinctive carbon fiber air scoop, with central fixing braces and upward tilting winglets on the outer edges. Viewed from the side, the front end of the Aventador J looks like a Formula 1 racing car.<br><br>
				<h3>Wheels With CFRP Fan</h3><br><br>
				The black of the carbon fiber parts is visibly evident throughout the car – the significantly wider sill elements and the mighty rear diffuser form a perfect contrast to the rich red body paintwork. The special red color was developed specifically for this Aventador – a highly intensive red with a slight chrome effect.<br><br>
				The wheels, of course, were also developed specifically for this car, with 20-inch rims at the front and 21-inch at the rear. The five-spoke aluminum wheels have a central lock system and an additional carbon fiber insert that functions like a small fan for optimum brake ventilation.<br><br>
				Naturally, the doors on the Aventador J also open upward. They are considerably thinner than on the Aventador and are fitted with a tiny, fixed side window. The muscular flanks around the rear wheels are hallmark Lamborghini and make it immediately apparent where this particular bull keeps his power.<br><br>
				<img src="../images/lambo 5.jpg"><br><br>
				<h3>Rear End</h3><br><br>
				Because of its ample dimensions, the eye is drawn inexorably to the rear end. It consists in principle of just three elements – the carbon-fiber rear diffuser, the four huge tail pipes and the rear lights with their typical Lamborghini light signature in the form of a Y. The remaining surface area is for heat dissipation and is enclosed only by a black metal mesh. The rear end is crowned by an enormous fixed spoiler mounted on the bodyshell by two arms. ‘Form follows function’ to the nth degree. The spoiler is supported by two pillars connected by the diffuser: clearly inspired by racing.<br><br>
				<h3>Special Bumpers</h3><br><br>
				In comparison with the Aventador LP 700-4, the exclusive Aventador J has special front and rear bumpers. Both bumpers have been supplemented with carbon fiber fins that act as flow deviators. Their purpose is to achieve a significant increase in the vehicle’s downforce at both the front and the rear.<br><br>
				<h3>The Outside Comes Inside</h3><br><br>
				The Aventador J’s exterior and interior forms flow seamlessly into each other. This supersports car turns its inside outward and is as open as it can possibly be. Conversely, the exterior ‘flows’ through the interior – a red stripe runs from the front hood, between the two wind deflectors, over the dashboard, down the console to the center tunnel and back up between the seat backs, before leaving the interior and heading for the engine cover panel.<br><br>
				<h3>Interior</h3><br><br>
				This band of color connects the front and the rear of the car, creates a visual separation between the driver and passenger space and is interrupted only by a small control panel housing the starter button and the switches for lights and transmission. The Aventador J is equipped neither with a navigation nor car audio system, nor does it have the associated screen or air conditioning controls – these would simply detract from its one and only raison d’être as an extreme driving experience. What remains, of course, are two programmable TFT displays behind the steering wheel.<br><br>
				<img src="../images/lambo 6.jpg"><br><br>
				The engine cover also brings the inside to the outside. To be more precise, it is not so much a cover but more a framework.<br>
				This part has a new geometry (X shape) and is made of carbon fiber. Two large openings lay bare both cylinder banks of the mighty V12 power unit with its 6.5 liters of displacement – a truly stunning sight for every automobile aficionado.<br><br>
				A unique work of art licensed for the road However, at the end of the Geneva Motor Show, this sight will be the preserve of just one – the future owner of the Lamborghini Aventador J. There is only one of them, no prototypes and no others for the Lamborghini Museum. The buyer can look forward to a truly unique, street-legal work of art. He will possess the most extreme expression of Lamborghini DNA in existence and a real masterpiece of high technology. But the many other fans of the super sports cars from Sant’ Agata Bolognese can rest assured – the Aventador success story has only just begun.<br><br>
				<img src="../images/lambo 7.jpg"><br><br><br>
				<h2>Verdict</h2><br><br>
				This is the Lamborghini Aventador J. The Aventador J. It’s a one off car but not a concept car that will end up in Lamborghini’s museum.
				No, this amazing machine, unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show, will be sold to a punter who will be a) very rich, b) very ­extrovert and c) very lucky.You will notice that the car does not possess a windscreen, yet it is not a track special that cannot be registered for the road.The J, which gets its name from motorsport’s ruling body the FIA’s Appendix J technical regulations for racing cars, is obviously based on the Aventador supercar that was launched last year.I thought that the Aventador wasn’t quite as wild as a Lamborghini should be, almost too easy to drive.<br><br>
