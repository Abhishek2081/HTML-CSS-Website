			<br><br><h1>2016 Koenigsegg Regera</h1><br>
			<hr>
			<br><br>
			<img src="images/koenigsegg.jpg"><br><br><br>
			<p>
				The 2016 Koenigsegg Regera is definitely one of the hybrid supercars.  Koenigsegg launched at the 2015 Geneva Motor and since then it generated too much hype among many car lovers and enthusiasts.<br><br>
				Koenigsegg founder Christian von Koenigsegg purchased a Tesla Model S P85+ in 2013, and was impressed by the car's ability to instantly deliver power without the need for a downshift or to wait for turbo lag. He was especially impressed with the direct and intuitive experience provided by an electric car like the Tesla, remarking that the instantaneous response of the motors was something even a Formula One car could not attain with a traditional internal combustion engine. Von Koenigsegg sought to combine this desirable aspect of electric powertrains with the traditional Koenigsegg experience of a lightweight, powerful sports car.<br><br>
				Realising some form of compromise was necessesary, von Koenigsegg decided to look to a hybrid solution. By removing the traditional 7-speed dual-clutch transmission and switching to a single-gear direct drive system, Koenigsegg mitigated the added weight of the three electric motors and a 4.5 kW·h battery pack installed in the Regera as compared to the previous Agera models. The single-gear electrical solution also provided the instant response that von Koenigsegg sought, while the onboard internal combustion engine would then maintain the rapid acceleration and power at higher speeds where the electric motors are less effective.<br><br>
				<h2>Features & Highlights</h2><br><br>
				<h3>Koenigsegg Regera Engine</h3><br><br>
				<img src="images/koenigsegg 1.jpg"><br><br>
				Besides a regular engine, the Koenigsegg Regera also carries an electric unit which gives out 700 horsepower and 663 lb-ft of torque with 9 kWh liquid cooled battery. As a result, the car now has an amazing 1,341 horsepower, simply making it the most powerful hybrid supercar in the world. Its combustion engine is a 5.0 liter V8 which produces an out-of-this-world 1,100 horsepower and 922 lb-ft of torque.<br><br>
				With its power, the Koenigsegg Regera can reach speeds of up to 250mph and can easily dash from 0-60mph in just 2.5 seconds. The 2016 Koenigsegg Regera is indeed a powerful car thanks to the latest technologies incorporated inside it. It is simply the most powerful and fastest car in production.<br><br><br>
				<h3>Chassis, Design And Aerodynamics</h3><br><br>
				<img src="images/koenigsegg 2.jpg"><br><br>
				As we got used to by this manufacturer, the exterior of 2016 Koenigsegg Regera is definitely one of the hybrid supercars. is made in “batmobile manner”. Its appearance is very futuristic and for sure it won’t leave you indifferent. The basic design is not too much different from previous models and we can say that’s a good thing.<br><br>
				It has new headlamps, deeper front splitter which adds to the car’s aggressive appearance, while around back are new LED taillights and restyled spoiler which can be moved hydraulically. Another difference that makes this model stand out from other cars made by this Swedish manufacturer, are center-placed dual exhaust exits.<br><br><br>
				<h3>Koenigsegg Regera Interior</h3><br><br>
				The 2016 Koenigsegg Regera interior features a new center console, very cool design of doors while almost all surfaces are covered in leather, Alcantara and carbon fiber. Machined aluminum accents make the interior even classier, while its LCD instrument cluster looks like Agera’s.<br><br>
				<img src="images/koenigsegg 3.jpg"><br><br><br>
				<h2>Koenigsegg Regera Press Release</h2><br><br>
				The Regera was created as a luxury Megacar alternative to Koenigsegg’s traditional extreme lightweight race-like road cars. Even though the One:1 and Agera have surprising levels of practicality, creature comforts and features, their primary focus is, and has always been, to be the overall fastest cars on the planet – around a racetrack or elsewhere.<br><br>
				Regera is Swedish for “to Reign” – a suitable name for a machine that offers a never seen before combination of power, responsiveness and luxury – creating a true Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde persona.<br><br>
				In spite of all its advanced technology and creature comforts, the Regera is comparatively light. Therefore it can still perform competitively around a race circuit. According to us, the only Hyper/Megacar that could be faster around a circuit, is another Koenigsegg. However, out in the open the Regera will reign as the king of the road, as the fastest accelerating, most powerful production car ever.<br><br>
				The Regera will be handcrafted in only 80 examples. Apart from being a suitable production run for Koenigsegg´s newly upgraded and refurbished production facility, the number 80 also symbolizes the principle of domination, control and achievement in Pythagorean Numerology.<br><br>
				With the introduction of the Regera, Koenigsegg will, for the first time ever, have two parallel models in production.<br><br>

				<h3>The Finer Details</h3><br><br>
				The heart and soul of every Koenigsegg is its Internal Combustion Engine – the ICE. The ICE of the Regera follows the path of its siblings, based on the proven and extremely reliable Koenigsegg dry-sump twin turbo, DOHC, 5.0 liter V8, which in Regera guise pumps out an incredible 1100 Bhp on regular pump gas with astonishing ease and responsiveness. The ICE of the Regera features a truly unique titanium fish tail exhaust system, envisioned by Christian von Koenigsegg and produced by Akrapovic. The fish tail exhaust layout enables the shortest most optimal routing, giving less weight and less back pressure. But most importantly a very unique and a fantastic sound!<br><br>
				Given this the Regera is not what we at Koenigsegg would call a hybrid, as it does not have the traditional shortcomings of a hybrid. Instead the Regera is a new breed of Koenigsegg – and car for that matter.<br><br>
				Traditional, so called parallel, hybrids are compromised and heavy, as they have two independent propulsion systems. Alternatively, series hybrids are less compromised when it comes to weight, complexity and costs, but instead they are compromised when it comes to efficiency, as there is too much energy conversion going on.<br><br>
				This brings us to the Koenigsegg Direct Drive Transmission or KDD for short – invented by Christian von Koenigsegg and developed for the Regera by the Koenigsegg Advanced Engineering team.<br><br>
				The Patent Pending KDD system replaces the combustion engines traditional transmission and gives the added benefit of pure EV mode. What is unique is that the KDD manages to create direct drive to rear axle from the combustion engine without the need of multitude gears or other traditional types of variable transmissions, with inherently high energy losses.<br><br>
				During highway travel, for example, the KDD reduces drivetrain losses, compared to traditional transmission or CVT by over 50%, as there is no step up or step down gear working in series with the final drive – just direct power transmission from the engine to the wheels.<br><br>
				<img src="images/koenigsegg 5.jpg"><br><br>
				To supplement the energy from the combustion engine and to allow for torque vectoring, regenerative braking, extreme drivers response, reverse and energy conversion, there are three YASA developed electric motors. YASA´s axial flux motors are extremely power dense and allow for direct drive, making them a key-ingredient for the KDD. One YASA for each rear wheel, giving direct drive – this time electric – and one on the crankshaft, giving torque-fill, electrical generation and starter motor functionality.<br><br>
				The three electric motors constitute the most powerful electrical motor set-up in production car history, replacing the gears of a normal transmission while adding; power, torque, torque vectoring and yet still able to remove weight.<br><br>
				The battery pack and PDU for the KDD were developed and manufactured together with Electric Supercar virtuoso Mate Rimac and his engineering team. The 620 volt battery pack is of the latest fully flooded type and is the most power-dense battery pack ever created for a road going car with 9,27 kWh of energy, 67 liters of volume and 115 kg of weight. Still, a full 500 kW can momentarily be drawn during acceleration and over 150 kW can be absorbed by the battery-pack during regenerative braking and ICE power generation mode.<br><br>
				Every cell of the pack is carefully monitored for voltage, state of charge, health and temperature. The cells are enclosed in a fully machined aluminum casing for safety and stability. The battery is located in the most protected area of the car – the carbon-aramid chassis tunnel. The whole battery pack is actively cooled by external radiators and the Regera’s all new electrical air-conditioning system, which also can pre-cool the car via the Koenigsegg app on a warm day.<br><br>
				The complete KDD system, including the battery, adds a mere 88 kg to the Regera´s weight, compared to what the Regera would have weighed with a traditional ICE, coupled to a 7 speed DCT transmission instead of the KDD. Presently no other hybrid Hypercar even comes close to this type of weight ratio for their electrification. This is interesting, as they all have smaller battery capacity and less electric power than the Regera.<br><br>
				<img src="images/koenigsegg 6.jpg"><br><br>
				To put it into perspective, the Regera has almost triple as many electric Bhp (700 Bhp) and over 300 Bhp more than its closest hybrid rival. Still the Regera manages to be very competitive weight wise, while including unusual features such as 6 way adjustable electrical seats and a fully robotized body work. This is no small feat and is a true testament to the meticulous nature of the Koenigsegg engineering team.<br><br>
				The combination of electrical and combustion power is just mind boggling. When you get up to speed, the system really comes into play -How about 3.2 seconds between 150 to 250 km/h and under 20 Seconds from 0 to 400 km/h?<br><br>
